My 0x03-git readme
So far..

I created an account on github, then generated a personal access token.
I updated my profile on the ALX intranet and then created my first repository.
I proceeded to cloning the repository, created the readme file, added, committed, and pushed the modifications.
I created a new directory 0x03-git and its readme file which i'm currently editing :).
I created all files accordingly, and also a brangh called update_script, then made changes to the master/main as required.
I make this change to the 0x03-git readme file as required, after which I'll have to pull the changes from the terminal (i.e locally).
